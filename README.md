# Learner Data Processing Application

This JavaScript program processes data related to a course, assignment group, and learner submissions, and calculates learner data based on specified criteria. The program adheres to the following requirements:

## Requirements Met

1. **Variable Declaration**: Variables are declared using `let` and `const` where appropriate.

2. **Operators and Calculations**: Various calculations are performed on variables and literals to calculate learner data.

3. **Cached Values**: Strings, numbers, and Boolean values are cached within variables throughout the program.

4. **if/else Statements**: The program uses at least two `if/else` statements to control program flow.

5. **try/catch Statements**: The program includes `try/catch` statements to manage potential errors, such as invalid or missing data.

6. **Arrays and Objects**: The program creates and manipulates arrays and objects to store and process data.

7. **Retrieval, Manipulation, and Removal**: The program demonstrates the retrieval, manipulation, and removal of items in an array and properties in an object.

8. **Functions**: Repeated tasks are encapsulated in a function named `getLearnerData`.

9. **Program Output**: The program outputs processed data as described in the assignment instructions.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.

2. Copy the JavaScript script and save it to a file, e.g., `learner-data.js`.

3. Run the script using Node.js:

   ```shell
   node learner-data.js
